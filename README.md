# Yikwid Browser settings

Yikwid Browser settings for all platforms.

Users may want to find **their own setup** and to use our default configuration as something to build on top of. This is now easier thanks to the [overrides](https://librewolf.net/docs/settings/#where-do-i-find-my-librewolfoverridescfg).

## Useful links
- [website](https://yikwid.net/): read the docs.

## Notes and thanks
- This repository benefits from the knowledge and research provided by [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox), so special thanks to the project.
we do not use arkenfox's `user.js` but we try to keep up with it, and we also consider it a great resource for users who want to find their own setup.
- many thanks to the firefox team and to the people working on [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home);
- thanks to the whole LibreWolf community and to all their contributors of this repo.
